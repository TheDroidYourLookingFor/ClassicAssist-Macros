## ‚ö†Ô∏è  Deprecation Warning

UOSteam was abandoned by it's original developers
(Diego Alc√•ntara, Diogo Palma). It's currently in a
deprecated state and is not receiving
updates. ClassicAssist has fixed this by recreating
UOSteam. Unlike UOSteam the code for ClassicAssist 
is open source. The new macro engine uses Python so any
old macros will need to be converted to work.
